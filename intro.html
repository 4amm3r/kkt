			<p>Kitty Kat Time provides in-home cat care while you're away, with an emphasis on your cat's health and wellbeing. We can offer our own toys to initiate playtime and encourage exercise, which promote better sleep. To help calm your cat, we can provide music specially made for cats. We also provide any home care needed (getting the mail, watering plants, etc.) and send you daily email updates with pictures of your furry family member. We love getting to know every cat we meet and enjoy learning about his/her needs and unique personality. Hearing those satisfying purrs is music to our ears!<br/><br/> Licensed, bonded, and insured and certified in pet CPR and first aid. <br> We are a member of the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters (NAPPS).</p><br/><p>Services offered in Duvall, Carnation, Redmond Ridge, and Woodinville, WA</p><br/>
