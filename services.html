                <h4 class="pinktitleborder">Meet and Greet</h4>
                <p class="whitecontent">Before we start any services, we schedule a 30-60 minute consultation in your home to go over your pet's routine and address any questions you may have. We will cover topics such as your pet's food, litter, toys, hiding places, allergies, and any medications. We will obtain two keys from you at this time and will also go over home care such as watering plants, taking out trash/recycling, getting the mail, light/curtain rotation, etc. Also, we will bring forms and leave them with you to fill out later. We pick these forms up with payment on our first visit.<br>
                  <span class="pinktitle">&#10084;</span> $20 for each meeting<br>

If you are not comfortable with us safeguarding your keys, you may either drop off/pick up the keys from us, you can purchase a key lock box and provide us with the access code and location, or we can drive to your home for a fee:<br>
