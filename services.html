                <h4 class="pinktitleborder">Meet and Greet</h4>
                <p class="whitecontent">Before we start any services, we schedule a 30-60 minute consultation in your home to go over your pet's routine and address any questions you may have. We will cover topics such as your pet's food, litter, toys, hiding places, allergies, and any medications. We will obtain two keys from you at this time and will also go over home care. Also, we will bring forms and leave them with you to fill out later. We pick these forms up with payment on our first visit.<br>
                  <span class="pinktitle">&#10084;</span> $20 for each meeting<br>
